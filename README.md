# Typescript-Express Project Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for Typescript-Express project-based that reduces any hassle of configuring this and that! The project itself is mainly based on my preferences and intended for personal use, but hey you may need this 😏.

To run with nodemon:

```bash
    yarn dev
```

To run the tests:

```bash
    yarn test
```

To build:

```bash
    # I have not test this, check later lol.
    yarn build
```

**Note**:

1. Don't forget to name your project in `package.json`.
2. Eh? You want me to provide npm command too? Tartar sauce!
